## SSH (Secure Shell)

ssh is a secure protocol to remotely manage as well as connect to another computer across a network.
It encrypts all data, so it is safe now.

`ssh username@hostname using port`
- username: remote machine or for your user
- hostname: remotemac
- port: specify a value other than 22

> **what it do**: encrypt communicative, and also forward ports, as well as transfer files.
