#  Shell Commands - Study Notes: 

A quick overview of the shell commands I studied today:

## Basic Naigation:

- ```bash
  ls
  ```
  Lists all files and folders in the current directory.
- ```bash
  ls -a
  ```
  Lists all files including hidden ones .
- ```bash
  cd
  ```
  Used to navigate through folders.
- ```bash
  cat
  ```
  Reads and displays the contents of a file.


- Handling special filenames:
  - Filenames with spaces:
    ```bash
    cat "file with spaces"
    ```
  - Filenames starting with a dash:
    ```bash
    cat ./-
    ```

##  File Info and Types

-# Check the type of a file:

  - ```bash
    find .....
    ```
  Find some type of file
- ```bash
   find .
  ```
Start search in the current directory

- ```bash
  -type f
  ```
 Search only for files
- ```bash
   -size 33c
  ```
  Find files that are exactly using bytes
- ```bash
  --user nermine
  ```
  Find file owner ( me nermine !!)
- ```bash
  -readable
  ```
File is readable by the current user
- ```bash
  2>/dev/null
  ```
Suppress permission denied errors

If we did mix them all it gonna be like this :
```bash
find . -type f -size 33c -user bandit7 -readable 2>/dev/null
```
