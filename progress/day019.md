# Network Address Translation (NAT) Notes

**NAT:**  
IPv4 has a limited number of IPs and they are running out, so they let devices share the same public IP. This saves IP addresses and adds security.  

**IP Types:**  
- **Public IP:** Address that ensures devices can uniquely identify and reach others  
- **Private IP:** Used within local networks such as homes; ensures that these private networks operate independently  

**What is NAT:**  
A process carried out by routers that modifies the IP in their headers to the public IP.  

**Types of NAT:**  
- **Static NAT:** One-to-one mapping (Private IP â†’ Public IP), never changes  
- **Dynamic NAT:** Mapping depends on available IPs; ports of IPs are free  
- **Port Address Translation (PAT):** Shared one IP but different ports
