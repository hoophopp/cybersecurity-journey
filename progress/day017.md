# Network Communication

- Ensure that data is correctly sent and received between devices.  

---

## MAC (Media Access Control)
- Assigned to NIC.  
- Operating at the data link layer.  
- MAC address is 48 bits hexadecimal.  
- "Get MAC" is to get MAC address.  
- How MAC addresses are used in network communication.  

### ARP Communication
- Giving request to the router by knowing the IP to get the MAC address that has the same IP.  

---

## IP
- IP address allows identification and communication.  
- Works at the network layer of the OSI.  
- **IPv4**: 32 bits.  
- **IPv6**: hexadecimal, 128 bits.  

### How it works
- **Routing**: read IP, find best path.  
- **Flexibility**: IP can change depending on network/communication.  

---

## Ports
- Help direct network traffic to the correct application.  
- Work at the transport layer using TCP and UDP.  
- **HTTP**: port 80.  
- **HTTPS**: port 443.  

### Port Ranges
- **Well-known ports**: 0–1023.  
- **Registered ports**: IANA / SQL Server 1024–49151.  
- **Dynamic/private**: client app sessions 49152–65535.

## Step: Web Request
1. **DNS Lookup**: convert domain name to IP.  
2. **Data Encapsulation**: HTTP request / TCP with ports, find MAC to the router.  
3. **Data Transmission**: packet, MAC, IP.  
4. **Server Processing**: server receives packet, directs it to app port process, and prepares response.  
5. **Response Transmission**: response uses temporary port.
