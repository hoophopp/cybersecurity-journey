# DHCP Notes

**DHCP:**  
In network protocols that automatically assigns IP address and settings to devices.  

**How DHCP works:**  
It involves a series of interactions between the client and the DHCP called **DORA**:  
- **Discover**  
- **Offer**  
- **Request**  
- **Ack**  

**DHCP Server:**  
A network device, such as a router, that manages IP addresses. It has a list of IPs ready to give:  
- Pick free IP  
- Assign it to device  

**DHCP Client:**  
Any device that connects to the network  

**DORA Process:**  
- **Discover:** Try to find available DHCP server  
- **Offer:** The server receives the discover message and responds, proposing an IP  
- **Request:** The client receives the offer and replies with DHCP request to accept the offered IP  
- **Acknowledge:** Send ACK to confirm that it was accepted  

**Linux Command:**  
```bash
sudo dhclient wlan0
```
