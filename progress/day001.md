# What I Learned Today: Offensive Security

**Offensive security** is about getting authorized access to systems to find and fix security problems. It means testing systems by simulating attacks to help protect them from real hackers. This helps improve security by finding weaknesses before bad people do.

I also learned about **dirb**. It is a brute-force tool used to scan URLs by guessing directories and files on a web server. You run it in the terminal like this:  
`dirb + URL`  
This helps find hidden pages or directories that can be tested or exploited.

**Defensive security**, done by the Blue Team, is about being defensive. The team makes patches and updates to fix errors or holes in the system.
