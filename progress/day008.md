# 🐧Linux Shell Notes  `id`, `more`, `vi`, ... etc.

##  Check who you are

```bash
id
# Show your user info:
# id=11025(uihasjk) gid=11025(uihasjk) groups=11025(uihasjk)
```

---

## Read a file page-by-page

```bash
more /etc/passwd
# Use SPACE to go down, q to quit
```

Sometimes Bandit scripts (like /usr/bin/showtext) open a file using `more`.
You can **break out** of `more` by pressing `v`.

---

## Escape using vi

```bash
# Press 'v' when inside 'more' 
# It opens vi editor

# Then inside vi:
:!bash
# This runs a shell Now you're free to use normal Linux commands!
```

## Check another user’s shell

```bash
grep user45 /etc/passwd
# You’ll see something like:
# user45:x:11026:11026:user level 26:/home/user45:/usr/bin/showtext
```

This means logging into bandit26 runs a program instead of bash. You need to escape it using the trick above.

---

## After escaping, read the password!

```bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
# This prints the password to go to the next level
```

---

## Summary of Tricks

```bash
# See who you are
id

# Open a file page-by-page
more file.txt

# If you're in 'more', press 'v' to go to vi

# Inside vi:
:!bash      # Escape to real shell
:!ls        # List files
:!cat file  # View content of a file
:q          # Quit vi
```
