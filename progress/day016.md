# Networking Basics

## IP
- Bookbone of network.  

## Protocols
- Rule set to format and process data.  
- Each handle specific type of data.  

---

## Transmission
- The process of sending data.  
- **Analog**: use continuous signals.  
- **Digital**: employ discrete signals to encode data.  

### Transmission Modes
- **Simplex**: allow one way of communication.  
- **Half duplex**: walkie talkie.  
- **Full duplex**: phone calls.

## Components of Network
Network relies on four main groups:

1. **End devices**: PC, etc. that generate communication data.  
2. **Intermediate devices**: routers, switches, modems, access points that forward traffic.  
3. **Network media / software**: cables, wireless signals, protocols.  
4. **Servers**: host for services (file, mail, data use).

## Key Points
- **NIC**: give each device a unique MAC address.  
- **Router**: layer 3, route packets between networks using tables and protocols.  
- **Switches**: use MAC address to direct traffic within LAN.  
- **Hubs**: old, send data to all ports.  
- **Cables and connectors**: affect quality, e.g. RJ-45.  
- **Network management software**: monitors performance, detect fault, and enforce security.  
- **Software firewalls**: filter traffic, protect individual hosts.  
- **Server**: a powerful computer that delivers services to client devices over network.  
  - It manages data, controls user auth and permissions, and runs server-grade OS.

## IP Responsibilities
- Responsible for addressing, routing, linking, delivering data.
