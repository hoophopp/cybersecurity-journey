# Domain Name System (DNS)

DNS is the phonebook of the internet. It helps us find the right IP for a given name. DNS changes IP addresses to human-readable names to access online resources.  

## DNS Hierarchy
Organized starting from the root to lower layers:

- **Root Servers:** Top of DNS hierarchy  
- **Top Level Domains (TLDs):** Such as `.com`, `.org`, `.net`  
- **Second Level Domain:** Example → `example.com`  
- **Hostname:** `www`  

## DNS Resolution Process
We enter a name, and DNS finds its address. This process is called **DNS Resolution**.  

- **Recursive DNS:** Provided by internet service providers’ DNS servers

# Internet Architecture

Describes how data is organized and managed.  

## Different Architectures

### Peer to Peer (P2P)
- PCs or computers act as both client and server at the same time  
- Can be decentralized  

#### Advantages of P2P
- **Scalability**  
- **Resilience:** If one goes offline, others can function  
- **Cost distribution:** Cost-efficient  

#### Disadvantages of P2P
- **Management complexity:** Hard to control  
- **Potential reliability issue:** Resources can fail
