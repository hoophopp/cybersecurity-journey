# Networking Learning

- **Network**: collection of interconnected devices.  
- **Nodes**: individual devices connected to a network.  

## Types of Networks
- **LAN**: local area connecting.  
- **WAN**: network beyond their immediate.  
- The **Internet** is a giant WAN that connects with millions of LAN.

## OSI (Open System Interconnection)
Cut the internet work into **7 layers**:

1. **Physical layer**: transmit raw bits, deal with physical connection.  
2. **Datalink layer**: provide data transfer.  
3. **Network layer**: IP / router.  
4. **Transport layer**: TCP / UDP.  
5. **Session layer**: it more about session as you connecting to your edge.  
6. **Presentation layer**: translator between app and network format.  
7. **Application layer**: HTTP / FTP / SMTP / POP3 / HTTPS.

## TCP/IP Model
(Even IP has its own layers):

1. **Link layer**: correspondent to the physical data.  
2. **Internet layer**: IP / router, correspondent to the network layer.  
3. **Transport layer**:  
   - **TCP**: without losing data.  
   - **UDP**: without connection, can lose data.  
4. **Application layer**: HTTPS / FTP / SMTP / POP3.
